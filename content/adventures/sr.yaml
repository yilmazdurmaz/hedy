                    U nivou 1 možeš da osmisliš priču sa različitim glavnim junacima koje ćeš sam uneti.

                    Na prvoj liniji, koristi `{ask}` i upitaj ko će biti glavni junak priče.

                    Posle te prve linije, počni sa `{print}` ako rečenica treba da bude ištampana.
                    Koristi `{echo}` ako želiš da tvoj glavni junak bude na kraju rečenice.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} Glavni junak priče je
                    {print} Glavni junak će sada da ide da prošeta u šumu
                    {echo} On je pomalo uplašen,
                    {print} Čuje neobične zvuke svuda unaokolo
                    {print} Boji se da je ovo ukleta šuma
                    ```

                    ### Vežbanje
                    Sada osmisli svoju pricu sa najmanje 6 linija koda.
                    Ova priča ne sme biti ista kao kod iz primera.
                    Koristi bar jednu komandu `{ask}` i jednu komandu `{echo}`.
                    Možeš odabrati bilo koju temu.
                    Ako ne možeš da smisliš baš ni jednu, upotrebi neku od naših tema: odlazak u bioskop, sportska utakmica ili dan u zološkom vrtu.
                start_code: '{print} Tvoja priča počinje ovde'

                story_text: |
                    U nivou 2 možeš učiniti da tvoje priče budu još zabavnijim. Ime tvog glavnog junaka se sada može nalaziti bilo gde u rečenici.

                    Mada, za to moraš isprogramirati malo dodatnog koda. Glavnog junaka moraš sada imenovati prvo.

                    Onda možeš staviti ime bilo gde u rečenici.
                example_code: |-
                    ```
                    ime {is} {ask} Kako se glavni junak zove?
                    {print} ime će sada da trči u šumi
                    {print} ime je pomalo uplašen
                    {print} On odjednom čuje neobičan zvuk...
                    {sleep}
                    {print} ime je uplašen da je ovo ukleta šuma
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Vežbanje
                    Sada je vreme da dodaš promenljive u tvoju priču koju si osmislio u prethodnom nivou.
                    Idi u 'Moji programi', potraži svoju priču o avanturi u nivou 1 i prekopiraj kod. Dodaj taj kod u ekran za unos u ovom nivou.

                    Ovaj kod neće raditi u ovom novou, jer još uvek nisi koristio promenljive.
                    Promeni komande `{ask}` i `{echo}` u svom kodu u tačan oblik koji si naučio u ovom nivou.

                    **Dodatno** Dodaj komandu sleep u svoj kod da bi podigao napetost u svojoj priči.

                story_text: |
                    U nivou 3 možeš osmisliti priču da bude još zanimljivija. Možeš odabrati bilo koje čudovište, životinju ili bilo koju drugu prepreku, ovako:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    životinje {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} On sada cuje zvuk životinje {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Komanda `{add}` ti takodje može biti korisna u tvojoj priči.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} On čuje zvuk
                    životinje {is} 🐿, 🦔, 🦇, 🦉
                    životinja {is} {ask} Šta misliš da je to?
                    {add} životinja {to_list} životinje
                    {print} to je bila životinje {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    Ovo je primer komande `{remove}` u tvojoj priči

                    ### Vežbanje
                    Prekopiraj tvoju priču iz prethodnog nivoa u ovaj nivo.
                    U ovom novou si naučio 3 nove komande `{at} {random}` , `{add} {to}` i `{remove} {from}`.
                    Dodaj nove linije koda u svoju priču, tako da iskoristiš svaku komandu bar jednom.
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    {print} Njegov je postao previše težak.
                    {print} Unutra je bila flaša sa vodom, baterijska lampa i cigla.
                    ranac {is} vida, lampa, cigla
                    otpad {is} {ask} Šta bi iz torbe trebalo izbaciti?
                    {remove} otpad {from} ranac
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} Tvoja priča'

                story_text: |
                    Možda su primetio da još uvek postoji problem u prethodnim nivoima. Da li si probao da ištampaš rečenicu koja u sebi sadrži reč ime? `{print}` moje ime je ime.
                    To možeš rešiti u ovom nivou. Moraš koristiti znake navoda za sve šo planiraš da štampaš.

                    ### Vežbanje 1
                    Kopiraj primer koda i dodaj znake navoda da bi proradio.

                    ### Vežbanje 2
                    Idi nazad u prethodni nivo i kopiraj kod svoje priče. Dodaj znake navoda na odgovarajućim mestima kako bi kod proradio i u ovom nivou.
                    Obrati pažnju: Promenljive u tvojoj priči ne bi trebale da se nalaze izmedju znaka navoda. Baš kao druga linije koda u primeru. U toj liniji promenljiva ime se nalazi izvan znaka navoda.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    ime {is} {ask} _ Kako se zoveš? _
                    {print}  _ Glavni junak se zove _ ime
                    {print} ime  _ ide sada da šeta u šumu _
                    {print} ime _ je pomalo uplašen _
                    životinje {is} 🦔, 🐿, 🦉, 🦇
                    {print} _ On čuje zvuk koji pravi _ životinje {at} {random}
                    {print} ime _ se boji da je šuma ukleta _

                    U ovom nivou možeš isprogramirati različite završetke, koji će učiniti da tvoja priča bude još zanimljivija.
                    U primeru kod možeš videti kako možeš osmisliti dva različita završetka.

                    ### Vežba 1
                    Napiši novu kratku priču sa bar 6 linija koda u vezi teme koju si odabrao.
                    Nemas ideju? Odaberi onda jednu od ovih tema: superheroji, dosadan dan u školi, sam na napuštenom ostrvu.

                    Sada daj opciju da igrač odabere srećan ili nesrećan kraj priče, kao što je u primeru.
                    Isprogramiraj oba završetka.

                    ### Vežba 2
                    Iskopiraj priču koju si osmislio u svojoj avanturi u prethodnim nivoima.
                    Pronadji način da dodaš bar po dve komande `{if}` i `{else}` u svoju priču.
                    Može biti sa srećnim ili nesrećnim završetkom, ali možeš i na druge načine upotrebiti ove komande.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    ime {is} {ask} 'Ko šeta šumom?'
                    {print} ime ' šeta šumom'

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    naam = {input}("What's your name?")
                    {print}('Welcome to this story!')

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    like {is} {ask} What is your favorite animal?
                    {add} like {to_list} animals

                    ## Remove from
                    If you can add items to a list, of course you can also take them off. This is done with the `{remove} {from}` command.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, kangaroo
                    dislike {is} {ask} What animal do you not like?
                    {remove} dislike {from} animals
                    {print} I choose animals {at} {random}

                    We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two `{if}`s but can use `{and}` and `{or}`.

                    If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.

                    Now that you can use the `{print}` command, you are ready to learn the next command: `{ask}`. With the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question. Check it out:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello!

                    Then ask 2 more questions using the `{ask}` command, after each `{ask}` use an `{echo}` to print the answer on the screen.

                    ## The ask command
                    Now that we can use **variables** in our codes, we no longer need the `{echo}` command.
                    We can use variables to store the answers to our questions and this way we can use the answer to multiple questions in our codes.
                    Check it out:

                    This way your code is becoming interactive!

                    ### Exercise
                    In the previous tab you have practised with setting variables with the `{is}` command.
                    You have created at least 3 variables and used them with a print command.
                    Now, instead of setting the variables we want you to make the variables interactive, like we did in our example.

                    Copy your code from the previous tab and make the variables interactive by using `{ask}` commands.

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    Have fun!

                    ### Exercise 2 (extra)
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.

                    Znak više `>` proverava da li je prvi broj veći nego drugi, na primer uzrast `>` 10 proverava da li je uzrast veći od 10.

                    Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?
                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in this level!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {print} people {at} {random} has to do the dishes
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Make your own version of the dishwasher program. Firstly make a list of your family members.
                    Then think of a task that needs to be done, and let the computer decide who has to do the task with the `{at} {random}` command.

                    **Extra** Don't feel like doing the dishes yourself? Hack the program by removing your name from the list with the `{remove}` `{from}` command.
                start_code: '{print} Who does the dishes?'
            4:

                    With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing program even better.

                    ### Exercise
                    First, fill in right symbols or commands on the blanks to make this example program work.
                    Did you get it? Great! Now copy your own code from the previous level and make it work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {print} _ the dishes are done by _
                    {sleep}
                    {print} people {at} _
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Who does the dishes?'''
            5:
                story_text: |
                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!
                example_code: "```\npeople {is} mom, dad, Emma, Sophie\ndishwasher {is} people {at} {random}\n{if} dishwasher {is} Sophie {print} _ too bad I have to do the dishes _ \n{else} {print} 'luckily no dishes because' _ 'is already washing up'\n```\n"
                start_code: '{print} ''Who does the dishes?'''
            6:
                story_text: |
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count it in this level.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes = 0
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    {if} dishwasher {is} Emma emma_washes = emma_washes + 1
                    {print} 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?
                story_text_2: |
                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'Monday the dishes are done by: ' dishwasher
                    {remove} dishwasher {from} people
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    {print} 'Tuesday the dishes are done by: ' dishwasher
                    {remove} dishwasher {from} people
                    dishwasher = people {at} {random}
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Who does the dishes?'''
            7:
                story_text: |
                    With the `{repeat}` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for multiple days!
                    ### Exercise
                    Use the `{repeat}` command to decide on who needs to wash the dishes for an entire week. Each blank needs to be filled with one command or number!
                    **(extra)** Can you think of other tasks in the house? Adapt the code so it decides on three household chores. Do not forget to print what tasks it concerns!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    people = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Dishwashing will be done by ' _ _ _
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''Who does the dishes?'''
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can make a schedule for the whole week in an easy way!

                    ### Exercise
                    Add a second chore, such as vacuuming or tidying up, and make sure it is also divided for the whole week.
                    <br> **(extra)** The program is not fair, you can be unlucky and wash up all week. How could you make the program more fair?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    days = Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
                    names = mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    {for} day {in} days
                        {print} names {at} {random} ' does the dishes on ' day
                    ```

                    In this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is short for `{else}` `{if}` and you need it when you want to make 3 (or more!) options.
                    Check it out!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    prices = ['1 million dollars', 'an apple pie', 'nothing']
                    your_price = prices[{random}]
                    {print} 'You win ' your_price

                    {elif} your_price == 'an apple pie' :
                        {print} 'Lovely, an apple pie!'
                    {else}:

                    ## For
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals {is} dog, cat, blobfish
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'I love ' animal
                    ```

            11:
                story_text: |-
                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 10
                        {print} counter
                    {print} 'Ready or not. Here I come!'
                    ```
                start_code: |-
                    {for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 10

                    Now we are going to change indentation a little bit. Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 10:

                story_text: |
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    _ Who are you?
                    _ Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    _ I see... I see...
                    _ Your name is

                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Copy the example code into your inputscreen and fill in the blanks to make the code work.
                    **Extra** Change the code and let the fortune teller not only predict your name, but also your age, your favorite sports team or something else about yourself.

                story_text: |
                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

                    This level has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    ### Exercise
                    We have removed all the quotation marks from this example code, can you add them in all the right places?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your fortune teller code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.
                example_code: |

                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is your question:  question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2

                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.



                    ### Exercise
                    Can you think of your own (silly) fortune telling machine?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use `{repeat}` to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the `{repeat}` command.
                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller ask 3 questions and also print them!

                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but if not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and ask the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} How did I get here?

                    {print} and suddenly everything went black.
                    {print} But how did I end up on the floor...?
                    {print} My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
                    {print} What's that sound?
                    {print} Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
                    {print} I need to get out of here!
                    {print} There are 3 doors in front of me..
                    {ask} Which door should i pick?
                    {echo} I choose door
                    {print} ...?

                    {print} You run into the other room, but a monster_2 is waiting there for you!
                    {print} Oh no! Quickly get to the kitchen.

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    This haunted house game uses the connection between the lists you can use in this level.
                    For example: all the properties that belong to the zombie are first in all the lists, witch second and vampire third.

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice'
                    {else} {print} 'boo!'

                    ## If... Else...
                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.
                    Check out the example code.

                    ### Exercise
                    Add an {else} command to the example code. Make a block of line using indentation. You do this by starting each line with 4 spaces.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'What is your name?'

                    ## Variables
                    You can name a word with `{is}`. This is called a **variable**. In this example we made a variable called name and a variable called age. You can use the word name anywhere in your code and it will be replaced by Hedy, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Time to make your own variables!
                    In the example code we made an example of the variable `favorite_animals`. In line 1 the variable is set, and in line 2 we haved used the variable in a print command.
                    Firstly, finish our example by filling in your favorite animal in the blanks. Then make at least 3 of these codes yourself. Pick a variable, and set the variable with the {is} command. Then use it with a {print} command, just like we did.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    favorite_animals is _
                    {print} I like favorite_animals
                    ```
                start_code: |-
                    name {is} Hedy
                    age {is} 15
                    {print} name is age years old
            6:
                story_text: |
                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
            14:
                story_text: |
                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name != 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are not Hedy'
                    ```

                    {if} age < 13
                        {print} 'You are younger than me!'

                    ## 1 + 1
                    In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} '5 plus 5 is ' 5 + 5
                    {print} '5 minus 5 is ' 5 - 5
                    {print} '5 times 5 is ' 5 * 5
                    ```
                start_code: '{print} ''5 times 5 is '' 5 * 5'

                    So far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Two and a half plus two and a half is...'

                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'
                    {print} 'We need to use ' answer

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.

                    In this level you can make a list using the `{is}` command. You can let the computer choose a random item from that list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    In the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.
                    Give it a try!

                    ## Repeat with other commands and with variables
                    You have practiced the `{repeat}` command in combination with the `{print}` command now, but did you know you could also use other commands with `{repeat}` ?
                    In this example code you can see that `{repeat}` can also be used with an `{ask}`, `{if}` or `{else}` command.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 2 {times} answer = {ask} 'Did you know you could ask a question multiple times?'
                    {if} answer {is} yes {repeat} 2 {times} {print} 'You knew that already!'
                    {else} {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'You have learned something new!'

                story_text_2: |
                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    {print} 'Yay! It is your birthday!'

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ## Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.

                    ### Exercise
                    Copy your own restaurant code from to previous level to the input screen below.
                    Fix the code by replacing the `{ask}` and `{echo}` commands and using variables, like you've learned in this level.

                    Now that your code is working again, it's time to add something more.
                    Look at the last line of the example code: `{print} food with topping is on its way!`
                    In this single line 2 variables have been used to create a summary of the order.
                    Now add your own summary of the food and drinks ordered by the customer.

                    **Extra** Now that you've learned how to use variables, you can use as many variables in one line as you'd like. Can you add more variables to your code, like eat in or take-away, cash or card, with or without a straw etc.?

                    Add the right command on the blanks and indent the code correctly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    _ 99 {times}
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    With `{for}` you can print make the whole baby shark song (including all the other sharks in the family) in only 6 lines!

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you make the baby shark code even shorter by using a `{for}` command? Finish the example code.
                example_code: "```\nfamily = baby, mammy, daddy, grandma, grandpa\n_ _ _ _ \n  {print} _\n```\n"

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Print the song Five little moneys jumping on the bed. Look up the text if you don't remember.

                    **(extra)** Print the song Old MacDonald had a farm, and make sure all animals make a different sound, using an `{if}`.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    monkeys = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the `{for}` with `{range}` to make songs that use counting, like the 5 little monkeys.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks and make the code work! If you don't remember the song text, look it up yourself.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    The final line of the song is different from the others. Print this line inside the `{for}`, and use an `{if}` to make it work correctly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ monkeys _ _ 5 _ 1
                        {print} monkeys ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'
                        _

                    In this song we can make it even easier to program 'if you're happy and you know it, clap your hands'. Because we can put all of the actions in a variable, check it out:

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you add the right amount of indentation to each line to make the song play correctly?
                    Mind: Not all lines need indentation
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ actions = 'clap your hands', 'stomp your feet', 'shout Hurray!'
                    _ {for} action {in} actions
                    _ {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 2
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it'
                    _ {print} action
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it and you really want to show it'
                    _ {print} 'if youre happy and you know it'
                    _ {print} action

                    In this level, you can program a song like OldMacDonald even more quickly. You can connect the right animal to the right sound by simply putting them in the same place in the list.
                    The Drunken Sailor is also quickly made in this level. You only need 8 lines for the entire song, check it out!

                    In level 16 we made songs using lists. These programs however are no longer working properly in this level. The colons from level 17 and the brackets from level 18 still need to be added.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Now also look up your Old MacDonald song from level 16, and correct it.

                    In this level you can improve your Tic Tac Toe game with the {while} loop. With this loop you can combine the `{if} game != 'over'` and the `{for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 9` into one simple line.

                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                story_text: |
                    You can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or stairs!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.

                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`

                    ### Exercise
                    This is the start of a little staircase. Can you make it have 5 steps?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {forward} 20

                    {forward} 20
                    {turn} {left}
                    {forward} 20

                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use `{at} {random}` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time.
                    Use `{at} {random}` to choose a value from a list.
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you copy and paste lines 2 and 3 to create a longer random path?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    angles {is} 10, 50, 90, 150, 250
                    {turn} angles {at} {random}

                    In level 4 you have to use quotation marks with `{print}` and `{ask}`. Also when drawing!

                    ```
                    {print} _ Drawing figures _

                story_text_2: |
                    You can also change the color of the lines with the command `{color}`. Check out the example.
                    You can also use the command `{color} {white}` to make 'invisible' lines. You could use these white lines to move the turtle anywhere in the screen before you start drawing.
                example_code_2: |
                    ```

                    Fill in the correct numbers in this code to get it to work.
                    After you've done that, you can try to add the option backwards.

                    **Extra** Instead of using 'left' and 'right', remake the program with North, East, South and West.
                    This way you could add even more directions like Northeast and Southwest etc.

                    In this level you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                    **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
