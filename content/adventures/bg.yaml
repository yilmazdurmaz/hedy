                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Create a story of at least 5 sentences. You don't have to use 'name' just yet.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We have already prepared an `{input}` for you. First, use the `name` variable in your story.
                    Then add a second `{ask}` and use that variable as well.
                    Tip: Remember the commas in a `{print}` between text and variables!

                    Blackjack is a simple game of cards in which you have to get as close to 21 points as possible. You get two cards. Each card is worth their numeral value, and the face cards (Jack, Queen and King) are worth 10 points.
                    The Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose). The dealer, your opponent, also gets two cards.
                    If you want, you can get another card, and its points will be added to your total. The dealer can also choose to take another card.
                    But be careful not to get more than 21 points, because if you do, you lose!
                    The player who gets closest to 21, without going over it, wins!

                    With a `{for}` you can simplify tables of multiplication practise program.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Improve the example code such that it prints a nice multiplication table: <br> "1 times 10 is 10", "2 times 10 is 20", etc.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to your level 10 multiplication code, and modify it so that it uses a `{for}` and `{range}`.
                example_code: |

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Let's make the practice program a bit harder. The player now has to answers two questions correctly. Fill out the blanks to complete the program.

                    ### Exercise 2 (extra)
                    Sometimes, calculations have multiple correct answers. For example, 10 can be divided by 5 and by 2. So the question 'What number divides 10?' can be answered by 2 and by 5.
                    Ask for a calculation that has multiple correct answers, ask the player to answer it, and determine if it is correct using `{or}`.
                    Empty the programming field and create your own solution.

                    ```

                    `{ask}` {and} `{print}` still work as you know them. But `{if}` {and} `{repeat}` have changed!
                    You can now execute groups of code together, but you will have to *indent* the code.
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.

                    In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` {and} `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!
                    In the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces.

                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example `age < 12` checks if `age` {is} smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example `age <= 11`.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example `points > 10` checks if `points` is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example `points >= 11`.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:

                    {print} 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```

                    ## For
                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with 4 spaces.

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I‚Äôm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ### Exercises
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    This level has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 3 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 3, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.
                example_code: |

                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'

                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}
                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                    football = {ask} 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = {ask} 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    {print} 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'

                    In this level you can use the `{repeat}` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'You can {ask} 3 questions!'
                    {repeat} 3 {times} question = {ask} 'What do you want to know?'
                    answer = yes, no, maybe
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'My crystal ball says... ' answer {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    In the previous levels you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                    Now that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.

                    Now it's very hard to win this game, can you make it easier to win?
                    For example by only having 1 wrong door and 2 correct doors instead of 1 correct door and 2 wrong ones?

                    ## If... else....
                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'

                    Sometimes code with an `{if}` gets really long and does not fit on the line well. <br> You may also divide the code over two lines, starting the second line at the `{else}` like this:

                    You have learned to repeat a block of lines of code after a `{repeat}` command.
                    Now you can also use indentation to make blocks after a {if} or {else} command.

                    We also make a change in storing a word in a variable! You may now use `=` instead of  `{is}` when we store a name or a number in a variable, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = Hedy
                    answer = 20 + 4
                    ```
                start_code: |

                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    {if} age > 12
                        {print} 'You are older than I am!'
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    From this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name == 'Hedy'
                        {print} 'You are cool!'

                story_text_3: |
                    You can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:
                example_code_3: |
                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'

                    ## 1 + 1
                    In this level you learn something new: you can now also calculate.

                    The plus is easy, you write it like with math: `5 + 5` for example. The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.

                    The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!
                    That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as "5 times 5" that helps you remember it best.

                    ### Exercise
                    Finish the code. Each time a random letter should be chosen, which you have to press. You get a point for a correct press, and and two points deduction for a wrong press.
                    **(extra)** Clear the screen after each letter, and show the user how many points they have scored.

                    You can print text to the screen using the `{print}` command.

                    ### Exercise
                    In Hedy you will find exercises in every adventure. An exercise allows you to practise the new commands and concepts, and lets you give your own twist to the example codes.
                    In this exercise you will see a pink blank space. You have to fill something in the place of the blank space before the code can be ran.

                    Fill in the `{print}` command in the blank space and then add five more lines of code. Each line has to start with a `{print}` command.
                    Have fun!

                    We arrived at real Python code! That means we need to use parentheses with `{print}` and `{range}` from now on.
                    It also means you can use Hedy code from this level in any Python environment as long as you use the English commands. If you haven't until now, you can switch the toggle in the commands menu to do so.
                example_code: |

                        {print}('This is line ', i)

                    ## 'Quotation marks'
                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostrophes and change the spelling to I am or What is.
                    Check out the example code to see the wrong way of using apostrophes.

                    **All items in lists need quotation marks too**
                    Lists are texts, so they need quotation marks too. Mind that each single item on the list has quotation marks.
                    This allows you to save two words as 1 item on the list, for example 'Iron Man'.

                    ### Repeat commands and indentation
                    In this level you can repeat multiple lines of code with only 1 repeat command.
                    You do this by making a block of lines that you want to repeat.
                    The lines in this block will need **indentation** .
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of each line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} 5 {times}
                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'

                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ## Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man?'

                    _ {print} 'The muffin man'
                    _ {print} 'Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?'

                    In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only {echo} the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                    Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the drinks!

                    In this level you have to use quotation marks when using the `{print}` command.
                    Can you make your code from the previous levels work in this level too by adding the quotation marks?

                    Be careful! In the previous levels apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in this level Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                    So instead of typing  `{print} Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `{print} 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    This children's song counts down from 5 little monkeys to 1 monkey.
                    If you copy line 2 - 7 and paste it under the the code, you can sing the whole song!
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    number = 6
                    number = number - 1
                    print number ' little monkeys jumping on the bed'

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    The Drunken sailor song is given as sample code, but not yet working.
                    Can you make sure everything works again? To help you, we've put _ in the places of _some_ errors.

                    In the previous levels you've made a tic tac toe game. Now you've learned how to use the = sign, the == sign and the != sign.
                    You can use this knowledge in your new Taic Tac Toe game, like this:

                    In this level you can improve your Tic Tac Toe game with the {while} loop/ With this loop you can combine the `{if} game != 'over'` and the `{for} i {in} {range} 1 to 9` into one simple line.

                    In the previous levels the tic tac toe game had an annoying feature. After every move, you had to fill in yourself if you had won or not.
                    This made the game playable, but also quite slow. In this level we have learned the `{elif}` command, that could solve that problem.
                    To use the {elif} to let Hedy check whether or not a player has won is fun, but it also requires a fair amount of extra lines.

                    In the example code you see that we added the requirements to win (3 spots in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
                    You can find them in line 46 to 69. You can see that each time the requirement is met (so if a player has won) the variable game is set to 'over'.
                    This means that the {while} loop will be stopped and the game ends.

                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {turn} 90
                    distances = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60
                    {for} distance {in} distances
                        {forward} distance

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer = 0
                    {while} answer != 25
                        answer = {ask} 'What is 5 times 5?'
                    {print} 'A correct answer has been given'
                    ```
